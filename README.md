# Torque Accuracy Tool ðŸŽ¯

<br>The Torque Accuracy Tool will plot test data, remove transients and provide analysis on the accuracy of **Torque Output** against **Torque Measured**, in each or all operating quadrants, voltages and speeds.
<br>The tool can also be used to achieve the same analysis with **Torque Estimated**
<br>As the tool uses averaging within the analysis, there is an option to remove transients from the data so only steady state data is analysed
