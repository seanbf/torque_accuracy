# Torque Accuracy Tool 🎯
The Torque Accuracy Tool will plot test data, remove transients and provide analysis on the accuracy of **Torque Output** against **Torque Measured**, in each or all operating quadrants, voltages and speeds.
The tool can also be used to achieve the same analysis with **Estimated Torque**.
As the tool uses averaging within the analysis, there is an option to remove transients from the data so only steady state data is analysed.
